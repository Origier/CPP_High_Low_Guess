# CPP_High_Low_Guess

This game involves a secret number being chosen by the computer within a specific range (let’s say 1-100) and the player then tries to guess this number.
If the number they guess is too low, the program will say “too low” and if it is too high it will reply with “too high”. 
The player wins when they guess the correct number.

This idea came from the ebook called "The Programmers Idea Book" by Marty2
