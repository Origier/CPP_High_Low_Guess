// High Low Guessing Game
// By: Aaron McDonald
// This game generates a random number between 1 - 100 that the user must guess to try to get right
// On a failed guess the game will generate a response such as, too high or too low depandent on 
// how close the guess was to the number. A correct guess wins the game
